"""Minimal test-support shim: REPO_ROOT and the npm test double.

The old repository-presenter project's tests/support.py is a large builder module (synthetic
project roots, cursors, sealed bundles, disposable git repos) with a heavy dependency closure
(openai, httpx, components.issues, core.registry, core.state) none of which this repository has
pulled. Only REPO_ROOT and the two self-contained npm-stub helpers (fake_npm, npm_calls) --
ported verbatim, stdlib-only -- are needed by the extractors test suite ported under
migration/reuse-manifest.yaml's "extractors/platforms" entry. Port the rest of the old support.py
only alongside the modules it actually builds fixtures for.
