# Decision log

A running record of architectural/scope decisions this project has made that are not fully
captured by a single commit message, so they are not re-litigated or forgotten. Authority:
subordinate to `AGENTS.md`'s table — this file records decisions, it does not grant any authority
of its own. The live execution cursor for any decision here is `project/state.yaml`, never this
file.

Format per entry: date, decision, why, what it does NOT decide, where the detail lives.

## 2026-10-24: Port the old repo's no-op-proof/bundle-integrity layer additively; correct the premise that caching depends on it

**Decision**: build a new, additive no-op-proof + bundle-integrity + currency layer in this
repository, modeled on the old repository's `core/noop_proof.py` / `core/candidates.py` /
`components/readme/bundle/seal.py`, but introduced only for *future* cascades — never retroactively
applied to, or capable of invalidating, any already-produced candidate. Full assessment, target
design, and ordered implementation plan: `plans/PLAN_bundle_integrity_and_noop_proof.md`.

**Why**: the owner observed the old repo's sealed-bundle architecture (manifest + `CURRENT` pointer
+ dependency fingerprints + a lifecycle state machine) looks more traceable and accountable than
this repository's current flat-file evidence layout, and asked for a deep, first-principles
assessment before committing to a port. That assessment (a dedicated research pass against both
repositories' actual code, not from memory) found:

- The owner's specific premise — that the old repo's "zero new provider calls" caching is *driven
  by* the sealed-bundle format — is **not correct**. Caching is implemented by `core/llm/jobs.py`'s
  `CallStore` (a flat, content-addressed file cache keyed by request hash), which has **already
  been ported** into this repository and is **already working** (this session already found and
  fixed the one real bug in it — a throwaway `tempfile.mkdtemp()` workspace discarding the cache
  every run; see `project/state.yaml`). `CallStore` has no dependency on the bundle/manifest
  format in either repository's actual code.
- What the old repo's bundle layer genuinely provides, with **no equivalent in this repository
  today**, is real and worth building: a formal, process-independent no-op proof
  (`verify_noop_pair`/`measure_invocation`), tamper-evident bundle integrity, and a durable,
  machine-readable per-repository `CURRENT`/currency state — the exact vocabulary mission §8
  requires (`CURRENT, RECHECKED_CURRENT, UPDATE_OPTIONAL, UPDATE_REQUIRED, UNVERIFIED_SOURCE,
  UNVERIFIED_CHECK, INVALID_FACT, BLOCKED_EFFECT`), which this repository's current partial port of
  `readme/bundle/recheck.py` does not yet fully match either (a separate, smaller correction, not
  contingent on the rest of this decision).
- The old repo's `candidates.py` reader is structurally safe to introduce additively: verified
  directly that it silently does not count, read, or judge any repository with no `candidates/`
  bundle tree — the "never invalidate already-accepted candidates" requirement is a property of the
  code as written, not something that needs to be bolted on separately.

**What this does NOT decide**: it does not approve porting the *entire* old bundle system in one
undertaking (the original, broader "option A"). The plan explicitly narrows scope: port the
no-op-proof primitive first (smallest, zero-prerequisite, immediately useful against the
already-working cache); read the bundle writer (`seal.py`, 1,203 lines, not yet read at all) before
deciding how to port it; and treat the "reviewer" scope-runner as new design work against this
session's own `readme/review/independent_reviewer.py`, not a port of the disqualified old module.
It also does not change or re-port `CallStore`/the ledger — those are correct as they stand.

**Where the detail lives**: full evidence-cited assessment, target architecture, ordered
implementation steps, and verification strategy — `plans/PLAN_bundle_integrity_and_noop_proof.md`.
Live tracking card — `project/state.yaml`'s `PORT_BUNDLE_INTEGRITY_LAYER`.
